What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

It took me quite a while to get used to using 'self' and class objects. I took CSC 111 two years ago, so I had to reremember how python classes work. The class examples were incredibly helpful, especially the Old MacDonald one. I am very glad I went to office hours, because it really made the resale shop class make more sense. However, I think I should have asked for help in the question channel earlier in the week. It probably would have been more beneficial to ask for help earlier. I recommend taking breaks from your coding and asking for help!
